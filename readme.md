# fullstack: Nginx, VueJS and Express

I am working on this to easily be able to get started with a containerized stack using Nginx to serve the VueJS application as well as having Express running in the background to handle backend tasks.

### What's included
- Nginx Reverse v 1.13.10 with /api reverse proxy to Express
- VueJS  
- Node v6

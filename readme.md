# fullstack: Nginx, VueJS and Express

I am working on this to easily be able to get started with a containerized stack using Nginx to serve the VueJS application as well as having Express running in the background to handle backend tasks.

### What's included
- Nginx v 1.13.10 server with /api reverse proxy to Express
- VueJS  
- Node v6

### Commands:
start: `docker-compose up`: Starts webserver running on port 80

stop: `docker-compose down`: Brings down the containers
